      <h2 class="intro">The Origins of Lorem Ipsum Text</h2>

      <p class="intro">"Lorem Ipsum" is the common name for dummy text often used in the design, printing, and typesetting industries.</p>
<img class="intro" src="stylesheets/image/images.jpeg">
      <p>Designers discovered long ago that if you used real text with your design mockups, then clients would often get distracted by the meaning of the words; but if you use dummy text in a foreign language, such as Lorem Ipsum — which is excerpted from a play written in Latin by Cicero in 45 B.C. — then clients will ignore the text and focus instead on the design elements.</p>
