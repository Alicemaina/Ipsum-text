          <h2>The Origins of Lorem Ipsum Text</h2>

      <p class="intro">"Lorem Ipsum" is the common name for dummy text often used in the design, printing, and typesetting industries.</p>

      <p>Designers discovered long ago that if you used real text with your design mockups, then clients would often get distracted by the meaning of the words; but if you use dummy text in a foreign language, such as Lorem Ipsum — which is excerpted from a play written in Latin by Cicero in 45 B.C. — then clients will ignore the text and focus instead on the design elements.</p>
      <p> Printers have been using Lorem Ipsum since at least the 1500s, and it has remain essentially unchanged into the electronic age. It was re-popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and made even more commonly available through modern desktop publishing software, which often includes Lorem Ipsum as default filler.</p>
      <p>Today Lorem Ipsum is commonly used in mockups for brochures, layouts, and preliminary website designs. Below is some sample Lorem Ipsum text you may easily copy & paste into your work.<br>About lorem-ipsum-text.com and Ruby on Rails</p><p>This resource is provided by the Ruby on Rails developers at Atlas Web Development. Ruby on Rails is an agile development framework for creating high-performance websites, including e-commerce sites, content management systems, and custom database solutions. We commonly need Lorem Ipsum while designing mockups for new Ruby on Rails websites, and created this page to provide a convenient place access the sample text for future reference.
